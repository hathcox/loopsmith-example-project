# Story 1.2: Scene Setup — Ground Plane & Fixed Top-Down Camera

Status: ready-for-dev

## Story

As a player,
I want to see a ground plane from a fixed top-down camera view when I launch the game,
So that I have a clear visual play area.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. A `SceneSetup.cs` setup class in `Assets/Scripts/Setup/` programmatically creates the GameScene
2. The GameScene contains a ground plane GameObject with a BoxCollider (static) and a generated GroundMaterial (URP Lit)
3. The Main Camera is positioned directly above looking straight down providing a top-down view of the play area
4. The camera position is fixed and does not move during gameplay
5. GroundMaterial is generated into `Assets/Generated/Materials/`
6. No manual Inspector configuration is required — all values are defined in setup code constants
7. Pressing F5 regenerates the scene correctly

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [ ] Task 1: Create SceneSetup class (AC: #1, #6)
  - [ ] Create `Assets/Scripts/Setup/SceneSetup.cs` implementing `IGameSetup`
  - [ ] Set appropriate `ExecutionOrder` (should run early, e.g., order 100)
  - [ ] Define all configuration as code constants (ground plane size, camera height, camera rotation)
- [ ] Task 2: Generate GroundMaterial (AC: #5)
  - [ ] Programmatically create a URP Lit material in `Assets/Generated/Materials/GroundMaterial.mat`
  - [ ] Set appropriate color/properties for ground visibility
- [ ] Task 3: Create ground plane (AC: #2)
  - [ ] Create a flat cube/plane GameObject scaled to form the play area
  - [ ] Add BoxCollider (static, non-trigger) for physics support
  - [ ] Apply generated GroundMaterial
- [ ] Task 4: Configure camera (AC: #3, #4)
  - [ ] Position Main Camera directly above center of ground plane
  - [ ] Set rotation to look straight down (90 degrees on X axis)
  - [ ] Set camera to Orthographic or Perspective with appropriate field of view for full ground plane visibility
  - [ ] Camera has no movement scripts — fixed position
- [ ] Task 5: Create GameScene (AC: #1, #7)
  - [ ] Save the composed scene as `Assets/Scenes/GameScene.unity`
  - [ ] Verify F5 rebuild regenerates correctly

## Dev Notes

### Architecture Compliance

- **Setup-Oriented Generation Framework:** SceneSetup.cs creates ALL scene content programmatically. No manual Inspector work.
- **Material Generation:** Use `new Material(Shader.Find("Universal Render Pipeline/Lit"))` to create URP materials in code
- **Scene Saving:** Use `EditorSceneManager.SaveScene()` to persist the scene to disk
- **Constants Pattern:** All dimensions, positions, and colors defined as `const` or `static readonly` fields in SceneSetup

### Technical Requirements

- Ground plane recommended size: 20x20 units (large enough for gameplay, small enough for top-down visibility)
- Camera height: ~15-20 units above ground plane
- Camera rotation: `Quaternion.Euler(90, 0, 0)` for straight-down view
- Ground plane Y position: 0 (world origin)
- Use `GameObject.CreatePrimitive(PrimitiveType.Cube)` scaled to (20, 0.1, 20) for ground, or `PrimitiveType.Plane` scaled appropriately
- GroundMaterial: Set `_BaseColor` property for URP Lit shader

### File Structure Requirements

```
Assets/
├── Scripts/
│   └── Setup/
│       └── SceneSetup.cs          # NEW - creates ground plane + camera
├── Generated/
│   └── Materials/
│       └── GroundMaterial.mat      # NEW - generated by SceneSetup
└── Scenes/
    └── GameScene.unity             # NEW - generated scene
```

### Testing Requirements

- No EditMode tests required for this story (scene composition is visual/structural)
- Verification: F5 produces a scene with visible ground plane and correct camera angle

### Dependencies

- **Requires Story 1.1:** SetupRunner and IGameSetup interface must exist
